The smolvm adapter adapts an initialized `Machine` from `smolvm-embedded` into Flue's sandbox interface. Unlike a hosted sandbox service, smolvm runs locally through a host hypervisor.

## Quickstart

Add smolvm as a sandbox to any existing Flue project by running the following command in your terminal or coding agent of choice.

```bash
flue add sandbox smolvm
```

## Configure

| Requirement               | Purpose                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `smolvm-embedded` package | **Required** — Provides the initialized machine adapted by Flue.              |
| macOS or Linux host       | **Required** — Supplies suitable local virtualization and hypervisor support. |
| Credentials               | **Not required** — smolvm itself requires none.                               |
| Edge or Worker runtime    | **Unsupported** — These runtimes cannot execute a local hypervisor.           |

## Choose this adapter when

Use smolvm for trusted desktop, CI, or server environments where local microVM execution is the desired isolation boundary. The host running the Flue application must support the underlying virtualization mechanism; this is not a Cloudflare Worker sandbox option.

The adapter blueprint treats networking and machine lifetime as explicit choices. Do not assume a local VM has network access or that it will be cleaned up without your application doing so.
